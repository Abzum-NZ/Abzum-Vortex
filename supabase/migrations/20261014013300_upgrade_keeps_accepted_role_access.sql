-- An upgrade never drops role access; changed roles can be accepted at upgrade (#2817).
-- An upgrade that changed a permission's meaning (adding a field to Contact changes the contact
-- permissions' field lists) dropped that permission from every role's next revision, and role
-- evaluation required the role's meaning to equal the registered one, so every holder lost the
-- permission entirely: the Contacts list showed no record for anyone until the role was accepted.
-- A role now keeps exactly the meaning it was accepted under:
-- * A permission's continuity revision is its availability lineage: it advances only when the
--   permission is withdrawn or registered again, and a meaning change keeps it. A withdrawn and
--   re-registered permission is therefore a new grant for every role kind.
-- * The upgrade carries each permission the template still grants, in the same lineage, with its
--   accepted meaning; any meaning change still requires acceptance, whatever the release's version
--   class. The current-state check mirrors that carry-over exactly.
-- * Role evaluation returns every accepted meaning the caller holds through a live path (fields,
--   scope, action or record type as accepted); the field-bound resolvers and the share authority
--   read those same entries. Nothing is accepted or widened automatically.
-- * Role detail shows the accepted meaning (record scope and field policy), so the upgrade screen
--   can show every change accepting would apply.
