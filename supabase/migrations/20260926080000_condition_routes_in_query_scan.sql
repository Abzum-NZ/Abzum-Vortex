-- #1081: push saved-condition and relationship-inheritance access routes into
-- run_module_query's scan predicate.
--
-- The status quo narrows the scan to the caller's owner, owner-group and
-- direct-share records only when every eligible alternative has an exact table
-- form. A permission narrowed by a saved condition, however, still reached the
-- database without its condition, so a selective condition spent the 500-row
-- scan budget on rows it later refuses and returned short or empty pages.
--
-- This migration compiles each eligible alternative's saved condition into the
-- same candidate-scan predicate, over the record catalogue's own columns and
-- with the alternative's own bound parameters, and OR-es it with that
-- alternative's exact route test. The predicate only NARROWS: the compiler is
-- required to admit every row the condition engine admits, an unexpressible
-- route or condition contributes true, and every row the scan returns still
-- goes through read_record, the exact per-row decision. A route with no exact
-- stored form, such as all-records, an inherited-ownership chase or a
-- relationship chase, is left unrestricted so the per-row decision alone
-- decides it; a condition over a field with no matching stored semantics, a
-- read-time calculation, a missing condition, or any compiler failure likewise
-- pushes nothing. The scan can therefore never admit a row the exact decision
-- refuses.
--
-- Each statement below is identical to the canonical file
-- supabase/schemas/<schema>/<function>.sql changed in this commit. The two
-- functions whose return shape grows are dropped first, because PostgreSQL
-- cannot change a function's return type in place.

  'One bounded keyset page of rows readable through read_record for one installed Module query, each carrying the record''s concurrency number and the per-row capabilities from read_record_capabilities, each action decided exactly as its own writer decides it, with only the declared Record system values, or one refusal before any row is exposed; accepts a bound list component''s declared sortable, filterable and searchable field sets together with the viewer''s chosen sort, typed filter and search term, refuses a sort or filter outside the declared sets, keeps a user sort only over a field the record type declares sortable and the reader is guaranteed to see, ANDs the user filter with the published filter so it can only narrow, and matches a search only through searchable fields the returned row exposes to the reader; requires every filtered field to be declared filterable; pushes a filter or a sort into the candidate scan only for fields the reader is guaranteed to see for the whole record type, evaluates a filter on a possibly-withheld field per row, and keeps the keyset cursor over readable sort values and a record identity so no cursor carries a hidden field value and the scan order and budget never depend on one; narrows the scan with one predicate that OR-s every eligible alternative''s exact owner, owner-group and direct-share route test with its saved condition compiled over the record''s own catalogue columns where that condition can be expressed as a superset of the per-row decision, leaves the scan unrestricted where a route or condition has no exact stored form, and still decides every returned row through read_record; works out read-time fields, such as a deadline-passed calculation, inside the query at one statement timestamp in the organisation time zone, so no query is refused for freshness.';
